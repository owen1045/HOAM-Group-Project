    Our game code will allow users to remain entertained as
    they play on a field where their job is to score a goal by 
    entering it in the soccer net!
    
### What is the functionality of this application?
    The game's functionality flows through multiple stages.
    First, the user is greeted with the game title and the 
    play game button. Next, the difficulty screen has a 
    selection of three modes: easy, medium, and hard. Once selected,
    the user is on the game screen, attempting to score
    incoming goals. The score is displayed as they play and
    after the game ends. The final screen will show a message
    with the history of attempts and scores with a button to play again.
   
### How to clone\run this application?
